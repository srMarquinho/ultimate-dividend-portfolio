# Ultimate Dividend Portfolio
:moneybag: Ultimately an essential - powerful  - easy to use - dividend portfolio sheet. :moneybag:

## :beginner: Getting a copy

1. Make a copy of the spreadsheet.
    If sharing, bookmarking or saving the link. Use [this GitHub page](https://github.com/srMarquinho/ultimate-dividend-portfolio) as the copy link may likely change overtime.

    [Here is an example with my own portfolio for reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gr728XUxZ1yBe2oznmXLAW1LlwyGl_Io7DpbiPQMqFc/edit?usp=sharing)

    [**Here is the blank template you need to make a COPY**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZixfk57fWBB2Z80-TkbtwgfiLlOSZ8488CddZ8lMv0/copy?usp=sharing) - this will create a copy to yourself on Google Drive!!!

1. Install and authorize scripts. That's necessary to give scripts access to your sheets. You will only need to do this once.

- In the top menu click "PORTFOLIO" > "Install"
    
<div><img src="./images/PortfolioMenu.png" width="300"></div>
--
<div><img src="./images/Authorisation.png" width="300"></div>
--
<div><img src="./images/Verify.png" width="300"></div>
--
<div><img src="./images/Allow.png" width="300"></div>
    
- After giving the permissions, due to security polices you will have to click install again to actually run the install this time. If you see the Welcome side bar you are ready. (I know, a bit annoying planning a work around in the future)
-  In the top menu click "PORTFOLIO" > "Install"
- Don't worry. This is open source. Google just wants to ensure you are aware a script will run.
- The sidebar is where you can stay up to date with any update.

## :beginner: Instructions

1. Check _"Settings"_ sheet tab and choose your currency.

1. Cells you **should** change and add your own values are light or dark **YELLOW(ish)**.

  :warning: **DO NOT edit any other cell**. Everything else is automatically populated.

  <div><img src="./images/Table.png" width="150"></div>

1. That's all! You are ready. Start adding _"Transactions"_ to see the magic happen. (ensure `-` are actually `0`)

### Tooltips

- Check for tooltips by hovering over the first row cells.
- I encourage you to chase tooltips ;D

### _Overrides_ - (Missing data in the "Portfolio")

- This is optional.
- At times "the provider" may not have the information for the ticker you entered. Showing N/A.
- Again, **DO NOT edit any grey cell** in the "Portfolio", if you do it may brake the auto-populate.
- Instead use the tab _"Overrides"_ to enter the missing information you need.

### Sorting

- Sorting is one of the best features and it has being kept in mind during development.
- Order doesn't matter, all entries can be added in any order. A striped triangle in the first row can be used for re-ordering. For instance, you can order the "Portfolio" by name. My preferred way is by weight (Sort Z - A).
- In the _"Portfolio"_ section you can also drag and drop columns and rows to re-order (just don't delete them). How cool is that?
- Why not trying to sort by "Return %" or ex-dividend day? ;)

### Currency

- Once your "home" currency is chosen in the _"Settings"_, it should not be changed as it will be used for exchange based on the value added in _"Transactions"_.
- Tip: In _"Transactions"_ your "home" currency exchange value will always be 1.

### Tips

**Find:** You can use `ctrl f` (`cmd f` on mac) to find for keywords in your sheet.

**Too big:** Use `ctrl -` (`cmd -` on mac) to zoom out.

**Too small:** Use `ctrl +` (`cmd +` on mac) to zoom in.

**Hundreds of transactions to add:** You probably be alright adding the average price you paid for each stock. Unless you want a detailed summary. (transactions summary not yet available)

## ERROR Note

If you see #ERROR! or Loading...

Try refreshing, if that does not work check that the ticker is correct and reload again.

Please please please. Do not email me reporting these errors. They are Google errors and seem to be related to cache. Good luck ;)

I'm planning a workaround one day. :neutral_face:
