## :beginner: Getting a copy

1. Make a copy of the spreadsheet.
    If sharing, bookmarking or saving the link. Use [this GitHub page](https://srmarquinho.github.io/ultimate-dividend-portfolio/) as the copy link may likely change overtime.

    [Here is an example with my own portfolio for reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11TTXusLRZ4FY0hlNKK0wxT6kyhfAZi5dP8sACWZaauA/edit?usp=sharing)

    [**Here is the blank template you need to make a COPY**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKsZjc8phniiR7NSL_pzfpgbLte4eVXMxAm57KPmLdA/copy?usp=sharing) - this will create a copy to yourself on Google Drive!!!

1. Install and authorize scripts. That's necessary to give scripts access to your sheets. You will only need to do this once.

> Don't worry. This is open source. Google just wants to ensure you are aware a script will run.

  - In the top menu click "PORTFOLIO" > "About"

<div><img src="./images/PortfolioMenu.png" width="300"></div>

<div><img src="./images/Authorisation.png" width="300"></div>

<div><img src="./images/Verify.png" width="300"></div>

<div><img src="./images/Allow.png" width="300"></div>

- Reload the page. If you see the sidebar you are set. The sidebar is where you can stay up to date with any update.

## :beginner: Instructions

1. Check _"Settings"_ sheet tab and choose your currency.

1. Cells you **should** change and add your own values are light or dark **YELLOW(ish)**.

    :warning: **DO NOT edit any other cell**. Everything else is automatically populated.

    <div><img src="./images/Table.png" width="150"></div>

1. That's all! You are ready. Start adding _"Transactions"_ to see the magic happen.
    - Ensure `-` are actually `0`.
    - You can add one transaction per stock with the average value paid if that's preferable by you.

- **NOTE: If you are updating from beta.**
  - Copy and paste all yellowish cells and paste in the new sheet. (right click `Paste special` > `Paste values only`)
  - From the _Overrides_ section note that "Forward dividend" is no longer in use and the column has been deleted.

### Tooltips

- Check for tooltips by hovering over the first row cells.
- I encourage you to chase tooltips ;D

### _Overrides_ - (Missing stock data in the "Portfolio")

- This is optional.
- At times "the provider" may not have the information for the ticker you entered. Showing N/A.
- Again, **DO NOT edit any grey cell** in the "Portfolio", if you do it may brake the auto-populate.
- Instead use the tab _"Overrides"_ to enter the missing information you need.

### Sorting

- Sorting is one of the best features and it has being kept in mind during development.
- Order doesn't matter, all entries can be added in any order. A striped triangle in the first row can be used for re-ordering. For instance, you can order the "Portfolio" by name. My preferred way is by weight (Sort Z - A).
- In the _"Portfolio"_ section you can also drag and drop columns and rows to re-order (just don't delete them). How cool is that?
- Why not trying to sort by "Sectors", "Return %" or "Ex-dividend day"? ;)

### Currency

- Once your "home" currency is chosen in the _"Settings"_, it should not be changed as it will be used for exchange based on the value added in _"Transactions"_.
- Tip: In _"Transactions"_ your "home" currency exchange value will always be 1.

### Tips

**Find:** You can use `ctrl f` (`cmd f` on mac) to find for keywords in your sheet.

**Too big:** Use `ctrl -` (`cmd -` on mac) to zoom out.

**Too small:** Use `ctrl +` (`cmd +` on mac) to zoom in.

**Hundreds of transactions to add:** You probably be alright adding the average price you paid for each stock. Unless you want a detailed summary.

## "#ERROR!" or "Loading..." Note

If you see #ERROR! or Loading...

Use the menu at the top:
  - `PORTFOLIO` > `Refresh portfolio calculations` to refresh the cells.
  or try:
  - `PORTFOLIO` > `Refresh data` to retrieve fresh stock data.

They are Google errors and seem to be related to cache. Google caches each cell and sometimes they get stuck. :neutral_face:

Please please please. Do not email me reporting these errors.
